To create a database in MySQL, the CREATE DATABASE statement is employed followed by the desired name for the database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

3. Explain the distinction between the CHAR and VARCHAR data types.

CHAR: A fixed-length character data type where storage size is predetermined, padding trailing spaces to reach the defined length.

VARCHAR: A variable-length character data type where storage size is dependent on the actual data length, without any padding of spaces.

4. Elaborate on the differences between SQL and MySQL.

To delete a table in MySQL, the DROP TABLE statement is employed, which removes all data from the table.

```sql
DROP TABLE table-name;
```

20. How do mysql_fetch_array() and mysql_fetch_object() differ?

mysql_fetch_array() retrieves a result row as either a related array or a regular array, whereas mysql_fetch_object() retrieves it as an object.

21. What's the method for retrieving the top 10 rows?

To retrieve the top 10 rows, the LIMIT clause is used in the SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 0,10;
```

22. How does NOW() differ from CURRENT_DATE()?

NOW() returns the current date and time, while CURRENT_DATE() returns only the current date.

23. What is the purpose of the 'DISTINCT' keyword in MySQL?

The 'DISTINCT' keyword retrieves unique records by removing all duplicate entries from the result set.

24. Which storage engines are utilized in MySQL?

MySQL employs various storage engines or table types, each offering distinct capabilities and functions for storing and managing data.

```

26. How can data be inserted into a MySQL table?

To insert data into a MySQL table, the INSERT INTO statement is utilized.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field1, field2, field3)  
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

27. What statement is used to identify duplicate rows in a MySQL table?

The max_heap_table_size MySQL configuration variable is used to control the maximum size of the heap.

```sql
SET max_heap_table_size = M;
```

40. What is a view and how is it created in MySQL?

A view in MySQL is a virtual table that contains rows and columns like a real table but is based on the result set of a SELECT query. Views are created using the CREATE VIEW statement.

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions];
```

42. How can images be saved in MySQL?

Images can be saved in MySQL by converting them into blobs and then inserting them into the database.

43. What are triggers and how many types are available in MySQL tables?

Triggers in MySQL are procedural code that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a table. There are six types of triggers:

- BEFORE INSERT
- AFTER INSERT
- BEFORE UPDATE
- AFTER UPDATE
- BEFORE DELETE
- AFTER DELETE

44. What distinguishes MySQL MyISAM Static from MyISAM Dynamic?

MySQL MyISAM Static tables have a fixed width for all fields and are easier to recover in case of corruption. MyISAM Dynamic tables, on the other hand, do not have a fixed width for all fields and may store data like TEXT or BLOB.
